          <p id="aboutDescription">ResearchMyProfessor is a public website where
            students and industry professionals can locate specific research
            done at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. By using this
            website, students can be exposed to the different kinds of academic
            research occurring at the college. By providing more exposure to
            research, we aim to help improve research visability between
            professors and students. The website can also connect industry
            professionals seeking advice or specific research in academia.
